**************PURPOSE*************************

The program 
* reads a file of vectors
  (one vector per line;
  attributes are numbers, separate by white space)
* prints a file of vectors of the specified dimensionality
  The new vectors correspond to projections of the old vectors,
  such that the pair-wise distances are preserved
  as well as possible.


*************HOW TO USE IT********************

To see a demo:
   % make

To compile:
   % make main

To run (after having compiled it):
   % main <fname>
Full options:
   % main [-v] [-d <#dims>] <fname>
where
   -v		gives the verbose option
   -d <#dims>	sets #dims to be the number of columns in the output
		(default: #dims=2)

***********PROGRAMMING DETAILS*****************

class definitions, to implement FastMap
    object.[ch]		objects (ie., vectors)
    oa.[ch]		object arrays
    vector.[ch]		vectors with length
    matrix.[ch]		2-d matrices, with length

    file.*		contains string and file routines,
			to turn lines into objects
			and files into object arrays.
